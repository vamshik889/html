### Interlinkage of Promises, async/await, and fetch

## Promises and fetch: 
The fetch function returns a promise, making it perfect for use with promise-based methods like .then() and .catch().


## async/await and Promises: 

async/await simplifies working with promises by allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. When you await a fetch call, you're essentially pausing execution until the promise resolves, then handling the resolved value.


## Chaining and Error Handling: 

Using async/await, you can chain multiple asynchronous operations in a more readable manner and handle errors more gracefully using try...catch.
